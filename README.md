# Personal-Website

Here is my personal website. It includes an "About Me" section with bio information, a "Portfolio" section with links to my projects, and a "Contact" section for sending messages and questions to the author.

This site was created using HTML with bootstrap for the majority of media responsiveness. External CSS were used to add adding animation and other page styling. JavaScript and JQuery were used for some gradient animation and click commands.

You can find a link to the website [here](http://www.andrewjohnweiss.com).

List of Resources Used:

- Opening SVG animation was created with the help of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJNVramny9k&t=977s) youtube tutorial
